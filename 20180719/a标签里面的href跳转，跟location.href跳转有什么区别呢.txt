有一个bug百思不得其解
好好的H5页面在安卓机上就能正常跳转，为什么在IOS上就有问题呢
仔细看了一下，该跳转是给a标签绑定了一个onclick事件，然后再事件里面写了location.href进行的跳转
我尝试这把跳转方式改成a标签自带的href，居然就解决了
可是这是为什么呢

emmmm.......
百度了很多似乎跟我的情况都不一样

Wherever possible, you should use <a href="foo.html"> over window.location.href, for a number of very good reasons.

If you have javascript disabled, none of the links would work.
Spiders, such as Google Bot, do not interpret javascript, and so they won't follow any of your links.
IT BREAKS THE INTERNET. No, really though - the World Wide Web is built on the very basis of discoverable linkages between pages. Hiding these linkages with non-standard .. err, links, goes against that very premise.
It makes for a bad user experience: a user expects that when they mouse over a link, they will have access to some information:
the destination displayed in the status bar (very important!)
right-click -> copy link location
middle-click -> open new tab
etc
Using window.location breaks all of these
It's much easier!

这一段看不懂，先记下来，以后有时间看看
